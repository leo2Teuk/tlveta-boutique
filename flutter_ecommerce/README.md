# TLveta

TLveta is a Flutter Web storefront backed by the local Strapi v5 API.

For Strapi administration access, local setup, seed instructions, and complete
Postman request examples, see the [Strapi API guide](../strapi-cms/README.md).

## Run locally

Start Strapi on port `1350`, then run the storefront:

```powershell
flutter pub get
flutter run -d chrome --web-port 5000
```

Depuis la racine du dépôt cloné, pour démarrer Strapi sur le PC local :

```powershell
cd .\strapi-cms
$env:HOST = "127.0.0.1"
$env:PORT = "1350"
npm run develop
```

The API base URL defaults to `http://127.0.0.1:1350/api`. Override it at build
or run time with `--dart-define=STRAPI_API_URL=https://your-api.example/api`.

The browser app never embeds an API token or processes real card details.
Catalogue and category reads are public; opening a product and using the cart
require a customer account. Strapi grants storefront actions to the
Authenticated role and removes public cart permissions during bootstrap.

Every product has a required positive EUR price. The imported catalogue's
missing prices are populated locally, and `npm run seed` also fills a missing
price on an existing seeded product. The backend calculates order totals from
the current product prices and adds a fixed 4 EUR delivery fee.

## Demonstration payment

Checkout creates a pending order and opens a Stripe-inspired demonstration
screen. Selecting **Simuler le paiement** starts a server-timed 10-second
simulation. No card number is requested and no payment is sent to Stripe; after
the simulation, the order is marked as paid, the cart is cleared, and the home
page asks for the delivery address.
